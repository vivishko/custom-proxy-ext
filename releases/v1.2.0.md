## Overview

This release improves how proxy modes are controlled in the popup and fixes per-page behavior so current-site proxying works predictably without breaking global usage.

## New

- Clearer screen separation in the popup: main controls, proxies, and rules are organized into dedicated views.
- Per-page proxy mode now supports its own proxy selection for the current domain.

## Improvements

- Proxy mode controls were redesigned into clearer Global and "Only this page" interactions.
- Status messages now better reflect which mode is active and where the proxy is applied.
- UI layout and control alignment in the popup were refined for easier scanning and fewer accidental mistakes.

## Fixes & stability

- Fixed a bug where "Enable only on this page" could effectively disable expected proxy behavior.
- Fixed mode interaction so enabling per-page mode does not incorrectly force global mode on.
- Improved mode-priority behavior to better match user expectations for rules, per-page mode, and global mode.
