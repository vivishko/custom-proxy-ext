## Overview

This release introduces a flexible proxy management workflow with per-site rules, reusable proxy presets, and handy import/export tools.

## New

- Global proxy toggle to quickly enable or disable proxy usage for the browser.
- Support for reusable proxy presets (name, host, port, protocol, credentials, country).
- Per-site rules:
  - Use specific proxy for a domain.
  - Force `NO_PROXY` (always direct connection).
  - Use `RANDOM_PROXY` (deterministic proxy selection per host).
- Temporary direct mode for the current site (“bypass proxy for this domain” without touching global settings).
- Import / export of proxies to a JSON file.
- Import / export of site rules to a JSON file.
- Logging toggle in the popup (top-right):
  - Enables detailed debug logging in the background script.
  - Useful for checking which proxy is applied and why.

## Improvements

- More robust domain matching, including subdomains (most specific rule wins).
- Deterministic random proxy selection based on hostname for predictable load distribution.
- Generated PAC script now reflects:
  - Global proxy state.
  - Per-site rules.
  - Temporary direct sites.
- Cleaner popup UI with separate tabs for:
  - Current page & global settings.
  - Proxies.
  - Site rules.

## Fixes & stability

- Safer handling of missing or invalid proxy configurations (fallback to DIRECT).
- Additional error logging around PAC script generation and proxy updates.
- Minor UI and state sync fixes between popup and background.

## Tasks

There were no tasks system during this release.
